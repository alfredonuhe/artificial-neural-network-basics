# Artificial Neural Networks Course
This repository contains two coding assignments of the course Artificial Neural Networks:

  - An implementation of an Adaline Perceptron. [Link](adaline)
  
  - An implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron ANN. [Link](multilayer-perceptron)

Both implementations use the library [RSNNS](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/RSNNS/versions/0.4-14/topics/RSNNS-package).
